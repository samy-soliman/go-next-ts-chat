# Realtime chat built with Go, Next, and Typescript

![screenshot](/assets/appScreanShot2.JPG)

 
## In this project, we will:
1. Develop a Realtime web socket chat using Go, Next, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, and PostgreSQL.
2. Deploy it using Docker Compose.
3. Deploy it using Continuous Delivery to GKE using Github Actions.

# Development

- In this section, we look at the development perspective of the project, getting to know its architecture and how it works.
- In simple, it's a three-tier app:
    - The frontend is written in Next.js, tailwind css.
    - The backend with Golang.
    - The database with PostgreSQL.

# Deployment - How To Get the Project Working

## 1- Docker Compose
In This part we:
1. Use docker to containerize our **Nextjs** frontend, **Golang** backend and **Postgresql** database.
2. Make a docker compose file to spin up the project at the click of a button.
3. To see a run in action and To Learn how to get that working &#8594; [Docker Compose](https://github.com/samy-soliman/go-next-ts-chat/blob/main/ReadME/Docker-Compose.md)

## 2- GitHub Actions

In This part we:
1. Configure a domain and DNS server records for our app.
2. Write Kubernetes manifets to our containerized app.
3. Use of Kubenetes gatwayAPI to serve as a http loadbalancer to our app.
4. Write Two Github Actions Pipelines
    - CI for building, testing, linting and artifact saving.
    - CD for deploying our app to GKE.
5. Implement continuous Delivery methodology, beacause maybe we do not want all commits to go for production.
    - We implemented it using github actions **Environment** review option which gives us two features:
        - a trigger for our production deployment.
        - a review for the changes.
